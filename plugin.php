/*When assigning a version number to your project, keep in mind that WordPress uses the PHP version_compare() function to compare plugin version numbers. Therefore, before you release a new version of your plugin, you should make sure that this PHP function considers the new version to be “greater” than the old one. For example, 1.02 is actually greater than 1.1.*/
